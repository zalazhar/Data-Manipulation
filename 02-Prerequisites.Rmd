# Prerequisites

## Basic knowledge
We assume basic knowledge of Python or R: knowing how to ecexute code in your favourite IDE. 

## Dataset
We use the Titanic Dataset to implement the data manipulation formulas. The dataset can be downloaded as a csv file from Kaggle: 

## Python and R packages

**R:**  I've delibarately  chosen to implement the formulas in base R, and not depend on additional R packages, such as dplyr. The main reason is that understanding base first, makes switching to other packages much easier. The other way around doesn't always hold.


**Python:** The Python implemantations of the formulas are done using the library pandas. For more instructions on installing pandas on yoor computer, see [(https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)]
